					<h2>Current Results</h2>
					<p>Building upon its groundbreaking mission, WMAP has released its latest findings based on refined measurements from an additional two years of data. These results offer unparalleled insights into the universe's early stages and its ongoing evolution. The WMAP science team has conducted detailed studies on the temperature and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), achieving remarkable accuracy and precision. Through these studies, WMAP has unveiled significant aspects of the universe's fundamental properties. WMAP has precisely determined the age of the universe, the density of atoms, and the density of non-atomic matter, among other crucial parameters. These advancements have transformed cosmology from speculative theory to a precision science. By capturing the "baby picture of the universe," WMAP has provided invaluable insights into the universe's infancy, mapping its afterglow when it was a mere 375,000 years old. These observations support the prevailing "big bang" framework of cosmology. WMAP's observations bolster the theory of inflation, suggesting a rapid expansion of the universe in its earliest moments. This expansion generated minute fluctuations that eventually led to the formation of galaxies. Confirming predictions of inflation theory, WMAP has observed fluctuations in density across the sky, following a bell curve pattern with equal numbers of hot and cold spots. Additionally, it has verified the slightly larger amplitude of variations in density on larger scales. WMAP's measurements have revealed the composition of the universe, with ordinary atoms comprising only 4.6%, while dark matter and dark energy constitute 24% and 71%, respectively. Launched on June 30, 2001, WMAP positioned itself near the "second Lagrange point" of the Earth-Sun system, approximately a million miles from Earth. Over the years, WMAP has meticulously scanned the heavens, providing crucial data for cosmological research. With its final release of results, WMAP concludes its remarkable mission, leaving a profound impact on our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
					<h2 style="border-top: 1px solid #A3A3A3;">7 Year Results</h2>
					<p>The WMAP team has reported the first direct detection of pre-stellar helium, offering a crucial test of the predictions of the big bang model. By analyzing microwave patterns in the sky, WMAP, in conjunction with data from ACBAR and QUaD experiments, has discerned the presence of helium prior to the formation of the first stars. WMAP now provides 50% tighter limits on the standard model of cosmology, confirming its consistency with observations. Moreover, WMAP has detected a key signature of inflation, shedding light on the universe's early rapid expansion. The latest WMAP data offer significant insights into dark energy and the geometry of the universe. Combining WMAP with other data sources, researchers have constrained dark energy to be within 14% of the expected value for a cosmological constant, while the universe's geometry must be flat to within 1%. WMAP has placed new constraints on the number of neutrino-like species in the early universe, revealing an effective number of 4.34 Â± 0.87, in contrast to the standard model's prediction of 3.04. With high significance, WMAP has detected temperature shifts induced by hot gas in galaxy clusters. These observations challenge previous X-ray observations and numerical simulations, suggesting a need for a more comprehensive understanding of gas physics in cluster regions. WMAP has visually demonstrated that the polarization pattern around hot and cold spots in the map aligns with predictions from the standard model, providing further validation of cosmological theories.</p>
					<h2 style="border-top: 1px solid #A3A3A3;">5 Year Results</h2>
					<p>The 5-year data from WMAP reveals cosmic microwave temperature fluctuations across the entire sky. With an average temperature of 2.725 Kelvin, these fluctuations, represented as colors akin to a weather map, provide crucial insights into the universe's early conditions. WMAP meticulously measures the composition of the universe, offering snapshots of its evolution. The data indicate shifts in the relative constituents over time, with dark matter and atoms becoming less dense as the universe expands, while dark energy maintains its dominance. A visual representation illustrates the universe's evolution over 13.7 billion years. From the rapid expansion during inflation to the emergence of dark energy, WMAP provides a comprehensive timeline, illuminating key milestones in cosmic history. Analyzing temperature fluctuations across different angular sizes, WMAP unveils insights into the early universe's sound waves. The detection of harmonic overtones, particularly the third overtone, provides evidence for the presence and influence of neutrinos. The latest WMAP data herald three significant discoveries. Firstly, evidence of a cosmic neutrino background suggests a substantial role for neutrinos in the early universe, with their influence imprinted in the observed microwave patterns. Secondly, clear evidence of a drawn-out process in the creation of the cosmic fog by the first stars marks the end of the "dark ages." This revelation provides crucial insights into the universe's transition from a primordial state to one populated by stars. Lastly, tight constraints on the burst of expansion during inflation refine our understanding of the universe's earliest moments. By eliminating certain inflationary theories while bolstering others, WMAP's data offer valuable guidance for cosmological models, reshaping our perspective on the universe's formative stages. These findings revolutionize our understanding of the universe's infancy and development.
