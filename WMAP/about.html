					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) is a pioneering NASA Explorer mission launched in June 2001. Its primary objective was to conduct precise measurements in cosmology, the study of the universe's fundamental properties. WMAP has significantly contributed to our understanding of the cosmos, shaping the new Standard Model of Cosmology. Although WMAP's data stream has concluded, its comprehensive analysis has yielded groundbreaking insights into the universe's evolution.</p>

					<h2>Accolades</h2>
					<p>The WMAP team has garnered prestigious awards, including the 2018 Breakthrough Prize for Fundamental Physics and the 2012 Gruber Cosmology Prize. These accolades recognize their exceptional contributions to advancing our knowledge of the early universe and its formation.</p>
					<h2>2018 Breakthrough Prize</h2>
					<p>The Fundamental Physics Award was bestowed upon Charles L. Bennett, Gary Hinshaw, Norman Jarosik, Lyman Page Jr., David N. Spergel, and the 27-member WMAP Science Team for their detailed mapping of the early universe, enhancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and galaxy formation.</p>
					<h2>2012 Gruber Cosmology Prize</h2>
					<p>Charles Bennett and the WMAP team received the Gruber Prize for Cosmology for their meticulous measurements of anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which have provided crucial insights into the origin, content, age, and geometry of the Universe.</p>
					<h2>Contributions</h2>
					<p>The WMAP science team has significantly contributed to precision cosmology by mapping the pattern of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation with unprecedented detail. They have also determined the age of the universe to be 13.77 billion years with remarkable accuracy and refined our understanding of space curvature, indicating a nearly "flat" Euclidean geometry. Additionally, they have estimated the distribution of ordinary matter (baryons) and identified dark matter as 24% of the universe's composition. Moreover, the team has revealed dark energy's dominance, comprising 71.4% of the universe and driving its accelerated expansion. Their work includes detecting the polarization of microwave radiation, shedding light on the universe's reionization history, and confirming inflationary theory by observing slight variations in density across different scales, supporting the rapid expansion of the early universe.</p>
					<h2>Synopsis</h2>
					<p>WMAP's groundbreaking achievements have revolutionized cosmology, providing invaluable insights into the universe's origin, composition, and evolution. Through meticulous observations and analysis, WMAP has significantly advanced our understanding of the cosmos, leaving a lasting legacy in the field of astrophysics.</p>
